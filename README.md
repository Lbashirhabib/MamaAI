# 🤖 Pregnancy Risk Assessment AI

## Overview
This AI system is designed to assess the risk level of a pregnancy categorizing it as either **at risk** or **Medium risk** or **safe** and provide personalized recommendations to expectant mothers. The goal is to support early intervention, informed decision-making, and ultimately reduce maternal mortality through accessible, intelligent guidance.

## Features
- 🩺 **Risk Classification**: Uses medical data inputs to determine if a pregnancy is high-risk, medium risk or low-risk.
- 💡 **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers tailored advice based on the risk level, including lifestyle changes, medical follow-ups, and emergency preparedness.
- 📊 **Data-Driven Insights**: Leverages historical and real-time data to improve accuracy and relevance.
- 🌍 **Accessible Support**: Designed for use in low-resource settings to empower women and healthcare providers.

## How It Works
1. **Input Collection**: The user provides relevant health data such as age, blood pressure, medical history, symptoms, and lab results.
2. **Risk Analysis**: The AI model processes the data using trained algorithms to classify the pregnancy as either:
   - `Safe`
   - `At Risk`
   - 'Medium Risk'
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Based on the classification, the system generates actionable advice, which may include:
   - Scheduling antenatal visits
   - Nutritional guidance
   - Warning signs to monitor
   - Emergency contact planning

## Technologies Used
- Python (with libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Cloud deployment: streamlit

## Installation
